    "ans1": "Coffee cApp is an app that makes your Coffee break easier. It includes a safe, easy and convenient system for payment via smartphone. Paying for a product at a vending machine or topping up your e-purse has never been so simple! Enter the Coffee cApp code that you see on the vending machine and within a few seconds a credit will be transferred and visualised on the vending machine to enable your purchases.",
    "qust2": "What do I have to do?",
    "ans2": "Once you’ve downloaded the Coffee cApp app for Android or Apple, sign up. You can buy from the machine by putting money in your e-purse or by adding a credit card to your profile (not compulsory). It only takes a few seconds!",
    "qust3": "How are purchases made?",
    "ans3": "There are two different ways of making a purchase with Coffee cApp:direct purchases charged to your credit card and purchases via a virtual e-purse, which can be topped up with cash at the vending machine, or with a credit card. When at the enabled vending machine, choose your preferred payment method and enter the Coffee cApp code in the app. Within a few seconds you will receive a message of confirmation and you will be ready to enter your selection on the machine, and the system will automatically debit the required purchase amount.",
    "qust4": "How do I top up my e-purse?",
    "ans4": "To top up with cash follow these easy steps:1. Connect your e-purse to a vending machine; 2. Put your money in the machine; 3. Press the change return button on the vending machine to confirm (usually located near the coin slot); 4. Disconnect your e-purse.",
    "qust5": "Can I top up my e-purse with my credit card?",
    "ans5": "Yes, in this case you don’t need to be near a vending machine. Go to the \"e-purse\" section of the app and choose the top-up credit amount (note:you need to have added a valid credit card to your profile).",
    "qust6": "Can I top up my old key with Coffee cApp?",
    "ans6": "No, you can’t top up a key using the Coffee cApp app.",
    "qust7": "The app won't open or is blocked. What do I do?",
    "ans7": "Try to close the app and then restart it. If you have the same problem again, contact this address coffeecapp@venpay.it.",
    "qust8": "The app is not responding or does not connect to the vending machine. What do I do?",
    "ans8": "Coffee cApp needs an internet connection to function correctly. Check your phone for a valid GPRS data signal, or connect to a Wi-Fi network.",
    "qust9": "My e-purse credit has not updated with the last transactions. Why not?",
    "ans9": "Your e-purse credit and the list of the latest transactions are normally updated within a few seconds. In some situations (like if there are connection problems), it may even take up to a few minutes for an update to take place. If you think the app has not registered your latest transactions correctly, check for a signal, then log out and log back in again. If the problem continues, contact the address coffeecapp@venpay.it, giving the vending machine code and approximate date/time of transaction.",
    "qust10": "Where can I use Coffee cApp?",
    "ans10": "Coffee cApp may be used in every vending machine with the Coffee cApp symbol.",
    "qust11": "Do I need an NFC (Near Field Communication) phone or SIM to use Coffee cApp?",
    "ans11": "No, the service can be accessed using any Apple or Android mobile phone.",
    "qust12": "How much does it cost to use Coffee cApp?",
    "ans12": "Paying with Coffee cApp is completely FREE. You will only be charged for your purchase amounts or top-ups, without any added fees. When inputting your credit card details, a virtual transaction of 0.05 Euros will be processed, but this is just to check the validity of your card and you won’t be charged anything.",
    "qust13": "Are my card details safe?",
    "ans13": "Yes, your credit card details will be stored on a secure server, managed by a major bank (Monte dei Paschi di Siena), according to PCI Security Standards Council specifications. These details therefore cannot be accessed by the managers of the Coffee cApp service or by the vending machine manager.",
